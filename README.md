# 5 Day Weather Forecast

## Description

This app will allow a user to get a forecast for 5 days of weather in their city. The current day (1) and then the following 4 days. A user will be presented with a field to input a city, and upon clicking the search button, fields will be auto populated for the city name, temp, humidity, wind and an icon showing them a visual representation of the data.

A lot of elements were included in the making of this project, but the stable behind this was the fetch() function using a server side API call. The server sends a request to openweathermapapi, the server sends a request back, the data is presented in JSON format and we're able to comb through the data to decide what is shown to the user. For the UI, I had a little help thanks to bootstrap, and for the correct time stamp, I had help in the form of moment.js.

This app is very user friendly, and is something I intend to share with family and friends.
